| 5       | 1                       |
| 6+      | 0                       |

## Gotchas
* If you draw the king face up when removing characters imediately replace it with another.

* __1 point__ per gold cost of districts
* __3 points__ for having 1 of each of the five district colors
* __4 points__ for being the first to 8 districts
* __2 points__ for other players who made it to 8 districts
