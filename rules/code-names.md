## Setup

1. Arrange a 5x5 grid of random Code Name cards in the center of the table.
2. Appoint one Spymaster and one Operative per team.
3. Use the key card to determine the placement of agents, assassins, and bystanders.

## Player's turn

1. The Spymaster gives a one-word clue and a number that tells the Operative how many cards on the grid relate to the clue.
2. The Operative selects one or more cards based on the clue:
   * If the guess matches a friendly agent, it is covered with the team’s card.
   * If the guess matches a neutral bystander, the turn ends immediately.
   * If the guess matches an assassin, the team loses instantly.

## Scoring

Scoring is based entirely on team success:
* The team wins when all of their agents are identified.

## Game end

The game ends when:
* One team identifies all their agents (win).
* An Operative selects the assassin (loss for their team).
