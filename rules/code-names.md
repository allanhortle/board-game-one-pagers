## Setup

1. Arrange a 5x5 grid of cards on the table
2. Appoint one Spymaster per team.
3. Give the scenario card to the spymasters. 

## Play

1. The Spymaster from a team gives a one-word clue and a number that tells them how many cards on the grid relate to the clue.
2. The team selects one or more cards based on the clue:
   * If the guess matches a friendly agent, it is covered with the team’s card.
   * If the guess matches a neutral bystander, the turn ends immediately.
   * If the guess matches the assassin, the team loses instantly.

## Game end

The game ends when one team identifies all their agent or when someone selects the assassin (loss for their team).

## Gotchas 

You can only give one word
you can pick one more card than the number given by the spymaster
