## Setup

1. Each player takes a player board and places it in front of them.
2. Place the four adventurer figures and their matching temples on the game board:
   * One adventurer starts on each corner of your board.
   * Place the matching temples on the opposite corners diagonally.
3. Shuffle the jungle tiles and place them face down in a stack or bag for easy access.
4. The youngest player decides the first "leader" (or randomly assign this role).

## Player's turn

1. The leader draws and announces one jungle tile from the stack by its number to all players.
   * All players find the corresponding tile from their stack and either:
     - Place the tile on their board following placement rules.
     - Discard the tile to move an adventurer on the board.
2. Players take actions simultaneously.

### Placing jungle tiles

* Tiles must be placed unrotated (with their number upright) onto the grid of your game board.
* The numbers of the tiles do not affect placement rules, but they must fit within the grid.
* You cannot place tiles in spaces already occupied by adventurers, temples, or other tiles.
* Paths on the tiles must align with adjacent tiles' paths.

### Moving adventurers

* Instead of placing a tile, you may discard it and move one adventurer a number of steps equal to the number of exits on the tile:
   * Straightaway tiles allow 2 moves.
   * Tiles with paths ending in all directions allow 4 moves.
* Adventurers must follow the connected paths.
* Bases and temples are reached by landing exactly on their grid.

## Scoring

Players earn points by guiding adventurers to their temples and collecting treasures along the way.

* Gold: Scored by reaching temples. The first adventurer at a temple earns the highest gold prize token available.
* Diamonds: Earned by stopping on neutral tiles with treasure icons.

### Completion vision:
* Bonus for gold medals when all get unlocked treasures.
