## Order of round

### Remove Characters
Draw one character face down and, a number face up.

| Players | Number of face-up cards |
|---------|-------------------------|
| 3       | 0, each player gets 2 roles | 
| 4       | 2                       |
| 5       | 1                       |
| 6+      | 0                       |

### Choose Characters
The king chooses first and then the remaing cards are passed around the circle. Remaining cards are put face down on the table.

### Play Turns
* play goes in character order (not seat order)
* Take an action (take 2 gold __or__ draw 2 cards and keep 1)
* Build a distric card
* Use character power once

## Gotchas
* If you draw the king face up when removing characters imediately replace it with another.
* you cant have two of the same district
* dead bishops cant protect angthing
* assassin/dead people cant be stolen from
* theif doesnt get gold till just before their victims turn

## Scoring
When a player build 8 districts the game is over at the end of this round.
Ties are settled by ammount of gold. You can build more than 8 districts if you have the means to do so.

* __1 point__ per gold cost of districts
* __3 points__ for having 1 of each of the five district colors
* __4 points__ for being the first to 8 districts
* __2 points__ for other players who made it to 8 districts
